Application Gaps - 

1. Log out feature
2. The warning label should reduce by number of times the entry is already done. If 2 enteries are already done, then warning should show 2 more entries left for the day
3. Have options to iterate throgh desired date on Daily reports
4. When entering string instead of int in enter level field, it should throw a error instead of only taking the int present in the string
5. Edit option for levels should be provided. Instead of the delete and enter new value again


Found one BUG while automating- 

1. When in reports page, select the "Monthly" form and navigate back to "Daily" by clicking on the text. 
On clicking Daily, it is showing the Date as the next calender date to the current date. Even if there is no data for the mentioned date
